Rear-Load Dumpster: When to Get It<h2>
Go with a rear-load dumpster when you have tighter space, like narrow alleys or low-clearance areas, or need a more rugged container. Rear-load units allow easier placement behind commercial buildings or in industrial zones. They’re ideal for scheduled service in challenging spaces.
